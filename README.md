Thank you for visiting my GitHub.   
   
I'm currently a graduate student deepening my knowledge in Linux, particularly Embedded Linux for automotive platforms, and Edge AI.

In particular, I'm focusing on the challenges posed by the shift from distributed systems to centralized computing architectures in the automotive domains â€” especially SDVs.   

Additionally, I'm exploring effective ways to integrate automotive systems with Tiny ML models or On-device AI models â€” to ensure safety, power efficiency, and memory efficiency.

If these topics capture your interest, I would appreciate hearing about your experiences. 

Thank you.   
Geonha Park.
